Computational modeling of post-burn immune response

The main objective of this thesis is to build from the ground up a computational model that could demonstrate the recruitment and transition of inflammatory cells, the secretion and diffusion of cytokines, and analyze the influencing factors of the dynamics of inflammation in burn wounds. 

All simulations were performed using Compucell3D software(version 4.2.5) on MacbookPro M1. \emph{Fipy} is also incorporated in Compucell3D to solve diffusion equations. Programming was done in Python 3.7.
